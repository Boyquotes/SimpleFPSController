# SimpleFPSController

This is a first person character controller which implements mechanics found in popular games such as Quake and Counter-Strike: Source.

I have a YouTube playlist of tutorials that were created alongside this character controller which you can reference if you're curious how any part of it works, or want to learn about using Godot for 3D games:
